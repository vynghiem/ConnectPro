# ConnectPro
Group project for IT390 at GMU. A lightweight web app to optimize userâ€™s schedules by creating reminders in form of text messages. I helped to enhance the code for the  countdown progress bar. I led one of the small feature-based team of two and successfully completed the cookies feature - which was one of the main functions of our web app.
